This directory installs man pages corresponding to software delivered by
Server OS.  For mainly historical reasons, some of these live under
/smartdc/man, although they're still delivered into Server OS.

Some are built from markdown via ronnjs, others not.

In addition, there are some waifs and strays - such as the bzip2 manpages -
that are referenced from manifests other than man/manifest, and mainly here for
convenience.
